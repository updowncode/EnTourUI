These are direct, non-stop, flights to Beijing from Toronto and from Shanghai back to Toronto. No deviations are permitted.

Seat numbers are assigned by the airline and are released at time of issuing tickets. For those who wish to change their seats can do so upon check-in at the airport, subject to availability. Tour East Holidays cannot specifically assign and/or change seats due to airline group policy, and therefore cannot be held responsible for Air Canada’s seat assignment. Aeroplan points are not applicable on this trip. If departing from another city (not Toronto), please contact us at tour@toureast.com or 1.877.578.8888 for exclusive rates & schedules for other departure cities.As deviations are not permitted, if interested in departing earlier, staying later, or extending the trip, please contact us and we’ll be pleased to quote accordingly.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n       <br />\r\n        <div>\r\n            <strong>Prepaid Gratuities - INCLUDED:</strong>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div>\r\n            <p>Tipping is entrenched in tourism in China and certainly helps to encourage continued exceptional service.  For this tour, we facilitate pre-paid gratuities for your guides and drivers for your convenience and to ensure that you can simply enjoy your holiday without having to consider who & when to tip. These gratuities/tips are included in your trip cost. If you wish to tip over and above when in-destination, you may do so at your discretion locally. For any other service rendered, whether it be a pedicab ride, boat ride, meal, or another service provided, a nominal gratuity would be most appreciated. Your tour guides will keep you informed as necessary.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n       <br />\r\n        <div>\r\n            <strong>China Entry Visa & Travel Documents:</strong>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div>\r\n            <p>Canadian & U.S. citizens traveling to China require a visa to enter the country. The China visa must be applied for & obtained in advance. Citizens of other countries should contact an embassy or consulate to determine what travel documentation is required. For residents of Ontario and Manitoba, Tour East can help to facilitate your China visas for this trip at the fee as indicated, or you may wish to handle the visa application on your own in which this visa fee will be deducted from your invoice. For travelers who reside outside Ontario, it is recommended to coordinate your visa application with the respective Visa Application Center from your home province. We suggest to start arranging for your visa, either through Tour East or on your own, after final payment at about 60 days prior to departure. For full and detailed information on how to obtain your entry visa to China along with fees, locations, and more, please visit the following website or contact your travel consultant - http://www.visaforchina.org/. If you are applying for your visa on your own, please let your agent know as you may require additional documentation to submit. If you choose to do the visa application with Tour East, kindly note a brief summary of requirements below and speak with your travel consultant before submission as the visa application center changes their requirements frequently.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n       <br />\r\n        <div>\r\n            <strong>Requirements & Process:</strong>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div>\r\n            <p>1.Original passport valid for 6 months from the completion date of your trip.</p>\r\n            <p>2.Completed and signed China Visa application form.

However, these requirements are subject to change at any time.</p>\r\n            <p>The cost for the China entry visa is non-refundable.</p>           \r\n        </div>\r\n       <br />\r\n        <div>\r\n            <strong>Important Note: </strong>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div>\r\n            <p>If your passport shows that your place of birth is Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, or China, please contact us and/or the visa application center for additional requirements before submitting.</p>\r\n            <p>1. Passport - A valid passport is required for this trip. Your passport must have at least two blank visa pages and an expiration date of at least six months beyond the completion of your travel dates.</p>\r\n            <p>2. Accommodation - Accommodation used on this tour is at the international 4-star standard and is as outlined on the tour page on the Tour East website. Note that accommodation occasionally changes, but where and when this may be required, a similar or better alternative will be provided and advised before you depart on your tour. Hotels are based on two people sharing one room with 2 beds or 1 bed. For Triple Rooms, these are on request and will be 1 bed + extra rollaway bed, or a room with two beds to be shared between three people. Accommodation is adequate, but is not the primary focus of this trip. If looking for a luxury trip to China, or a tour using alternative hotels, please contact your travel consultant where a tailor-made and privately guided tour and itinerary can be customized especially for you to meet your requirements, interests and budget.</p>\r\n            <p>3. Meals - Meals are included as specified on the itinerary. Beverages are not included, with the exception of bottled water & Chinese tea. The included lunches & dinners on your tour will be at local Chinese restaurants in a group setting, unless otherwise mentioned, with an abundance of food to choose from. Your guide will be with you to assist with any questions and/or special requests. Breakfast is at the hotel with a selection of western and Chinese dishes. Some specific dietary requirements can be accommodated in China and some are more difficult; for any dietary restrictions, please advise your booking agent at your earliest convenience for advice and/or adjustments to be made. Occasionally, a supplement is applicable if additional arrangements are to be made to meet dietary requirements. Guide recommendations can be provided if desired for any excluded meals.</p>\r\n            <p>4. Sightseeing - All sightseeing tours as outlined in the itinerary are included with English speaking local guides in a vehicle chartered for the group. Optional tours are outlined as such and are offered at additional cost should you be interested. You may book and pay for the optional tours prior to departure with some savings, or opt to play-it-by-ear and book and pay on the spot with your tour guide. Please note that the English-speaking guides and drivers in each city, town or area, will not fly with you from one city to another. They are your expert local guides in each of their particular regions. Tour East reserves the right to adjust the sequence of sightseeing if required to ensure all listed excursions are included. Please use sightseeing order on the itinerary as a guideline.</p>\r\n            <p>5. Airport Transportation - For international arrivals/departures, transfers are included with meet & greet. A representative will be at the airport holding a signboard for easy identification. You will then be driven to your hotel for check-in.</p>\r\n            <p>6. Optional Tours - In addition to your included tours, there are some additional optional activities/shows that are offered with this trip. Note below for a summary. If you wish to pre-book any of these optional tours with your trip, please advise your travel consultant. You may also wish to book these locally on the spot with your tour guide where a slightly higher cost will be applicable.</p>\r\n            <p>7. Domestic Flights – If your trip includes domestic flights within China, the checked baggage allowance is limited to one piece per person (weight up to 20 kg). Excess baggage may incur baggage fees levied by the airlines. Note that your international flight baggage allowance will permit more baggage than domestic flights, however we strongly encourage and recommend guests on this tour to travel with the domestic baggage allowance in mind, plus a carry-on, to avoid any excess baggage fees and/or delays upon check-in. Tour guides will not be on board the aircraft with you.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n            <p>8. Train Travel – If your trip includes train travel, note that some handling of your own luggage is required while making your way through the train station. There is space on board the train for luggage, but space is limited so we encourage traveling with only 1 suitcase and 1 carry on bag. Tour guides will not be on board the train with you.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n            <p>9. Handicrafts, Shopping & Cultural Insights – This tour, and with travel in China and many other countries in the world, there are shopping/comfort stops on tour where you can learn & shop, take a rest, or just stretch your legs. This is a normal practice in China where even just a quick stop helps with your total trip cost. The tour guides must make these stops, although they can be brief, and no purchase is necessary. This is not a shopping tour in that you are shopping all-day-everyday, but there are some educational shopping components included in the itinerary. These shopping and cultural stops for some are a highlight, and for others they do not hold much interest, we understand, so if you are not interested in a trip with shopping stops included, please speak with your travel consultant at time of booking as this trip may not be for you. Some guests may find that some stops are more interesting than others, so if you are not interested in shopping, please use this time for a bathroom break, to rest, or to simply learn more about China’s specialty products. Many of these specialty shops offer quality products and international shipping service. Your local guides will keep you well informed on tour, but if you would like to speak further on this beforehand, please contact your travel consultant.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n            <p>10. Physical & Cultural Preparation – Please be prepared for walking with comfortable shoes. You will find that walking is common on your daily excursions, some of which will be on uneven terrain or city streets, in museums, around indoor/outdoor attractions with varied grounds, and other landscapes. Although your tour includes porterage at the hotels and on/off coaches or in/out of smaller vehicles, all guests will need to carry their own luggage inside the airports/train stations and in other various instances. This is kept to a minimum, but keep in mind that there will be some lifting of your own luggage throughout your tour. You can expect a level of culture shock from exposure to different lifestyles and signs of poverty to varied cuisines and limited English accessibility in certain locations. To respect the local culture is paramount and will help with adjusting and truly experiencing and immersing yourself in the country. Should you have any particular considerations (ie; mobility, dietary, etc.) please be sure to let us and/or your travel agent know at the earliest to ensure this trip is right for you and/or that the necessary arrangements can be made.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n            <p>11. On-Tour Baggage – We recommend that guests bring one suitcase with wheels that weighs 20kg / 44lbs or less, and one carry-on at no more than 7kg. We do not suggest traveling with more than one large suitcase each to keep your transit comfortable and without excess baggage fees. Vehicles used on this trip have adequate space for each person to travel with one large suitcase and one carry-on, along with a camera bag, day bag, and/or purse, for example. If you plan to travel with more luggage than this on your trip, please advise your travel consultant to ensure ample space is available.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n            <p>12. Weather – The climate of China is temperate, similar to parts of the United States and Canada. As China is a large country covering vast geographic points from the high altitudes of Tibet to the deserts of Northwest China to the coastal city of Shanghai and southern tropics of Hainan Island, the weather you can anticipate will vary greatly on the season you are traveling and the destinations that are part of your tour. In short, Spring and Fall months are ideal, summer can be uncomfortably hot and sticky and winter quite cold with regional snow.<br>\r\nThe rainy (or monsoon) season extends from April to October, with varying degrees of rain from region to region.<br>\r\nWhile China is a year-round destination, the months of May, September, and October are ideal months for travel anywhere in the country. In the north, the winters are cold, and summers warm, with moist monsoon air streams making it hot. Note that 80% of China's rainfall occurs between late May and early October, mostly in the Southern regions. June through August is a good time to visit central and northern China. Spring and autumn are the best months for travel in Southern China.<br>\r\nSevere rainstorms can cause flooding and landslides. Flooding is common in central, western and southern China, particularly areas bordering the Yangtze River. Typhoons are common along the southern and eastern coasts. Keep informed of regional weather forecasts, avoid disaster areas and follow the advice of local authorities. Air pollution is severe, especially in heavily industrialized areas. Monitor air pollution levels as they change quickly. Your local guide will keep you informed of weather patterns during your tour.<br>\r\nAs a guideline of what to anticipate on your trip, kindly note below for average temperatures for Beijing & Shanghai. This is a guideline only, weather patterns vary year to year and remain unpredictable.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n            <p>13. Itinerary Disclaimer – Occasionally our itineraries must be modified due to inclement weather, seasonal transport route amendments, government functions, traffic/roadwork/detours, and/or force majeure. Changes, although rare, may occur with little or no notice, so please be prepared for adjustments to the itinerary if necessary.</p>\r\n        </div>",

Seat numbers are assigned by the airline and are released at time of issuing tickets. For those who wish to change their seats can do so upon check-in at the airport, subject to availability. Tour East Holidays cannot specifically assign and/or change seats due to airline group policy, and therefore cannot be held responsible for Air Canada’s seat assignment. Aeroplan points are not applicable on this trip. If departing from another city (not Toronto), please contact us at tour@toureast.com or 1.877.578.8888 for exclusive rates & schedules for other departure cities.As deviations are not permitted, if interested in departing earlier, staying later, or extending the trip, please contact us and we’ll be pleased to quote accordingly.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n       <br />\r\n        <div>\r\n            <strong>Prepaid Gratuities - INCLUDED:</strong>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div>\r\n            <p>Tipping is entrenched in tourism in China and certainly helps to encourage continued exceptional service.  For this tour, we facilitate pre-paid gratuities for your guides and drivers for your convenience and to ensure that you can simply enjoy your holiday without having to consider who & when to tip. These gratuities/tips are included in your trip cost. If you wish to tip over and above when in-destination, you may do so at your discretion locally. For any other service rendered, whether it be a pedicab ride, boat ride, meal, or another service provided, a nominal gratuity would be most appreciated. Your tour guides will keep you informed as necessary.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n       <br />\r\n        <div>\r\n            <strong>China Entry Visa & Travel Documents:</strong>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div>\r\n            <p>Canadian & U.S. citizens traveling to China require a visa to enter the country. The China visa must be applied for & obtained in advance. Citizens of other countries should contact an embassy or consulate to determine what travel documentation is required. For residents of Ontario and Manitoba, Tour East can help to facilitate your China visas for this trip at the fee as indicated, or you may wish to handle the visa application on your own in which this visa fee will be deducted from your invoice. For travelers who reside outside Ontario, it is recommended to coordinate your visa application with the respective Visa Application Center from your home province. We suggest to start arranging for your visa, either through Tour East or on your own, after final payment at about 60 days prior to departure. For full and detailed information on how to obtain your entry visa to China along with fees, locations, and more, please visit the following website or contact your travel consultant - http://www.visaforchina.org/. If you are applying for your visa on your own, please let your agent know as you may require additional documentation to submit. If you choose to do the visa application with Tour East, kindly note a brief summary of requirements below and speak with your travel consultant before submission as the visa application center changes their requirements frequently.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n       <br />\r\n        <div>\r\n            <strong>Requirements & Process:</strong>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div>\r\n            <p>1.Original passport valid for 6 months from the completion date of your trip.</p>\r\n            <p>2.Completed and signed China Visa application form.

However, these requirements are subject to change at any time.</p>\r\n            <p>The cost for the China entry visa is non-refundable.</p>           \r\n        </div>\r\n       <br />\r\n        <div>\r\n            <strong>Important Note: </strong>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div>\r\n            <p>If your passport shows that your place of birth is Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, or China, please contact us and/or the visa application center for additional requirements before submitting.</p>\r\n            <p>1. Passport - A valid passport is required for this trip. Your passport must have at least two blank visa pages and an expiration date of at least six months beyond the completion of your travel dates.</p>\r\n            <p>2. Accommodation - Accommodation used on this tour is at the international 4-star standard and is as outlined on the tour page on the Tour East website. Note that accommodation occasionally changes, but where and when this may be required, a similar or better alternative will be provided and advised before you depart on your tour. Hotels are based on two people sharing one room with 2 beds or 1 bed. For Triple Rooms, these are on request and will be 1 bed + extra rollaway bed, or a room with two beds to be shared between three people. Accommodation is adequate, but is not the primary focus of this trip. If looking for a luxury trip to China, or a tour using alternative hotels, please contact your travel consultant where a tailor-made and privately guided tour and itinerary can be customized especially for you to meet your requirements, interests and budget.</p>\r\n            <p>3. Meals - Meals are included as specified on the itinerary. Beverages are not included, with the exception of bottled water & Chinese tea. The included lunches & dinners on your tour will be at local Chinese restaurants in a group setting, unless otherwise mentioned, with an abundance of food to choose from. Your guide will be with you to assist with any questions and/or special requests. Breakfast is at the hotel with a selection of western and Chinese dishes. Some specific dietary requirements can be accommodated in China and some are more difficult; for any dietary restrictions, please advise your booking agent at your earliest convenience for advice and/or adjustments to be made. Occasionally, a supplement is applicable if additional arrangements are to be made to meet dietary requirements. Guide recommendations can be provided if desired for any excluded meals.</p>\r\n            <p>4. Sightseeing - All sightseeing tours as outlined in the itinerary are included with English speaking local guides in a vehicle chartered for the group. Optional tours are outlined as such and are offered at additional cost should you be interested. You may book and pay for the optional tours prior to departure with some savings, or opt to play-it-by-ear and book and pay on the spot with your tour guide. Please note that the English-speaking guides and drivers in each city, town or area, will not fly with you from one city to another. They are your expert local guides in each of their particular regions. Tour East reserves the right to adjust the sequence of sightseeing if required to ensure all listed excursions are included. Please use sightseeing order on the itinerary as a guideline.</p>\r\n            <p>5. Airport Transportation - For international arrivals/departures, transfers are included with meet & greet. A representative will be at the airport holding a signboard for easy identification. You will then be driven to your hotel for check-in.</p>\r\n            <p>6. Optional Tours - In addition to your included tours, there are some additional optional activities/shows that are offered with this trip. Note below for a summary. If you wish to pre-book any of these optional tours with your trip, please advise your travel consultant. You may also wish to book these locally on the spot with your tour guide where a slightly higher cost will be applicable.</p>\r\n            <p>7. Domestic Flights – If your trip includes domestic flights within China, the checked baggage allowance is limited to one piece per person (weight up to 20 kg). Excess baggage may incur baggage fees levied by the airlines. Note that your international flight baggage allowance will permit more baggage than domestic flights, however we strongly encourage and recommend guests on this tour to travel with the domestic baggage allowance in mind, plus a carry-on, to avoid any excess baggage fees and/or delays upon check-in. Tour guides will not be on board the aircraft with you.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n            <p>8. Train Travel – If your trip includes train travel, note that some handling of your own luggage is required while making your way through the train station. There is space on board the train for luggage, but space is limited so we encourage traveling with only 1 suitcase and 1 carry on bag. Tour guides will not be on board the train with you.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n            <p>9. Handicrafts, Shopping & Cultural Insights – This tour, and with travel in China and many other countries in the world, there are shopping/comfort stops on tour where you can learn & shop, take a rest, or just stretch your legs. This is a normal practice in China where even just a quick stop helps with your total trip cost. The tour guides must make these stops, although they can be brief, and no purchase is necessary. This is not a shopping tour in that you are shopping all-day-everyday, but there are some educational shopping components included in the itinerary. These shopping and cultural stops for some are a highlight, and for others they do not hold much interest, we understand, so if you are not interested in a trip with shopping stops included, please speak with your travel consultant at time of booking as this trip may not be for you. Some guests may find that some stops are more interesting than others, so if you are not interested in shopping, please use this time for a bathroom break, to rest, or to simply learn more about China’s specialty products. Many of these specialty shops offer quality products and international shipping service. Your local guides will keep you well informed on tour, but if you would like to speak further on this beforehand, please contact your travel consultant.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n            <p>10. Physical & Cultural Preparation – Please be prepared for walking with comfortable shoes. You will find that walking is common on your daily excursions, some of which will be on uneven terrain or city streets, in museums, around indoor/outdoor attractions with varied grounds, and other landscapes. Although your tour includes porterage at the hotels and on/off coaches or in/out of smaller vehicles, all guests will need to carry their own luggage inside the airports/train stations and in other various instances. This is kept to a minimum, but keep in mind that there will be some lifting of your own luggage throughout your tour. You can expect a level of culture shock from exposure to different lifestyles and signs of poverty to varied cuisines and limited English accessibility in certain locations. To respect the local culture is paramount and will help with adjusting and truly experiencing and immersing yourself in the country. Should you have any particular considerations (ie; mobility, dietary, etc.) please be sure to let us and/or your travel agent know at the earliest to ensure this trip is right for you and/or that the necessary arrangements can be made.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n            <p>11. On-Tour Baggage – We recommend that guests bring one suitcase with wheels that weighs 20kg / 44lbs or less, and one carry-on at no more than 7kg. We do not suggest traveling with more than one large suitcase each to keep your transit comfortable and without excess baggage fees. Vehicles used on this trip have adequate space for each person to travel with one large suitcase and one carry-on, along with a camera bag, day bag, and/or purse, for example. If you plan to travel with more luggage than this on your trip, please advise your travel consultant to ensure ample space is available.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n            <p>12. Weather – The climate of China is temperate, similar to parts of the United States and Canada. As China is a large country covering vast geographic points from the high altitudes of Tibet to the deserts of Northwest China to the coastal city of Shanghai and southern tropics of Hainan Island, the weather you can anticipate will vary greatly on the season you are traveling and the destinations that are part of your tour. In short, Spring and Fall months are ideal, summer can be uncomfortably hot and sticky and winter quite cold with regional snow.<br>\r\nThe rainy (or monsoon) season extends from April to October, with varying degrees of rain from region to region.<br>\r\nWhile China is a year-round destination, the months of May, September, and October are ideal months for travel anywhere in the country. In the north, the winters are cold, and summers warm, with moist monsoon air streams making it hot. Note that 80% of China's rainfall occurs between late May and early October, mostly in the Southern regions. June through August is a good time to visit central and northern China. Spring and autumn are the best months for travel in Southern China.<br>\r\nSevere rainstorms can cause flooding and landslides. Flooding is common in central, western and southern China, particularly areas bordering the Yangtze River. Typhoons are common along the southern and eastern coasts. Keep informed of regional weather forecasts, avoid disaster areas and follow the advice of local authorities. Air pollution is severe, especially in heavily industrialized areas. Monitor air pollution levels as they change quickly. Your local guide will keep you informed of weather patterns during your tour.<br>\r\nAs a guideline of what to anticipate on your trip, kindly note below for average temperatures for Beijing & Shanghai. This is a guideline only, weather patterns vary year to year and remain unpredictable.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n            <p>13. Itinerary Disclaimer – Occasionally our itineraries must be modified due to inclement weather, seasonal transport route amendments, government functions, traffic/roadwork/detours, and/or force majeure. Changes, although rare, may occur with little or no notice, so please be prepared for adjustments to the itinerary if necessary.</p>\r\n        </div>",

For this tour, we facilitate pre-paid gratuities for your guides and drivers for your convenience and to ensure that you can simply enjoy your holiday without having to consider who & when to tip. These gratuities/tips are included in your trip cost. If you wish to tip over and above when in-destination, you may do so at your discretion locally. For any other service rendered, whether it be a pedicab ride, boat ride, meal, or another service provided, a nominal gratuity would be most appreciated.

The China visa must be applied for & obtained in advance. Citizens of other countries should contact an embassy or consulate to determine what travel documentation is required. For residents of Ontario and Manitoba, Tour East can help to facilitate your China visas for this trip at the fee as indicated, or you may wish to handle the visa application on your own in which this visa fee will be deducted from your invoice. For travelers who reside outside Ontario, it is recommended to coordinate your visa application with the respective Visa Application Center from your home province. We suggest to start arranging for your visa, either through Tour East or on your own, after final payment at about 60 days prior to departure. For full and detailed information on how to obtain your entry visa to China along with fees, locations, and more, please visit the following website or contact your travel consultant - http://www.visaforchina.org/. If you are applying for your visa on your own, please let your agent know as you may require additional documentation to submit. If you choose to do the visa application with Tour East, kindly note a brief summary of requirements below and speak with your travel consultant before submission as the visa application center changes their requirements frequently.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n       <br />\r\n        <div>\r\n            <strong>Requirements & Process:</strong>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div>\r\n            <p>1.Original passport valid for 6 months from the completion date of your trip.</p>\r\n            <p>2.Completed and signed China Visa application form.

Canadian consular officials cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet entry requirements. This information on entry and exit requirements has been obtained from the Chinese authorities. However, these requirements are subject to change at any time.</p>\r\n            <p>The cost for the China entry visa is non-refundable.</p>           \r\n        </div>\r\n       <br />\r\n        <div>\r\n            <strong>Important Note: </strong>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div>\r\n            <p>If your passport shows that your place of birth is Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, or China, please contact us and/or the visa application center for additional requirements before submitting.</p>\r\n            <p>1. Passport - A valid passport is required for this trip. Your passport must have at least two blank visa pages and an expiration date of at least six months beyond the completion of your travel dates.</p>\r\n            <p>2. Accommodation - Accommodation used on this tour is at the international 4-star standard and is as outlined on the tour page on the Tour East website. Note that accommodation occasionally changes, but where and when this may be required, a similar or better alternative will be provided and advised before you depart on your tour. Hotels are based on two people sharing one room with 2 beds or 1 bed. For Triple Rooms, these are on request and will be 1 bed + extra rollaway bed, or a room with two beds to be shared between three people. Accommodation is adequate, but is not the primary focus of this trip. If looking for a luxury trip to China, or a tour using alternative hotels, please contact your travel consultant where a tailor-made and privately guided tour and itinerary can be customized especially for you to meet your requirements, interests and budget.</p>\r\n            <p>3. Meals - Meals are included as specified on the itinerary. Beverages are not included, with the exception of bottled water & Chinese tea. The included lunches & dinners on your tour will be at local Chinese restaurants in a group setting, unless otherwise mentioned, with an abundance of food to choose from. Your guide will be with you to assist with any questions and/or special requests. Breakfast is at the hotel with a selection of western and Chinese dishes. Some specific dietary requirements can be accommodated in China and some are more difficult; for any dietary restrictions, please advise your booking agent at your earliest convenience for advice and/or adjustments to be made. Occasionally, a supplement is applicable if additional arrangements are to be made to meet dietary requirements. Guide recommendations can be provided if desired for any excluded meals.</p>\r\n            <p>4. Sightseeing - All sightseeing tours as outlined in the itinerary are included with English speaking local guides in a vehicle chartered for the group. Optional tours are outlined as such and are offered at additional cost should you be interested. You may book and pay for the optional tours prior to departure with some savings, or opt to play-it-by-ear and book and pay on the spot with your tour guide. Please note that the English-speaking guides and drivers in each city, town or area, will not fly with you from one city to another. They are your expert local guides in each of their particular regions. Tour East reserves the right to adjust the sequence of sightseeing if required to ensure all listed excursions are included. Please use sightseeing order on the itinerary as a guideline.</p>\r\n            <p>5. Airport Transportation - For international arrivals/departures, transfers are included with meet & greet. A representative will be at the airport holding a signboard for easy identification. You will then be driven to your hotel for check-in.</p>\r\n            <p>6. Optional Tours - In addition to your included tours, there are some additional optional activities/shows that are offered with this trip. Note below for a summary. If you wish to pre-book any of these optional tours with your trip, please advise your travel consultant. You may also wish to book these locally on the spot with your tour guide where a slightly higher cost will be applicable.</p>\r\n            <p>7. Domestic Flights – If your trip includes domestic flights within China, the checked baggage allowance is limited to one piece per person (weight up to 20 kg). Excess baggage may incur baggage fees levied by the airlines. Note that your international flight baggage allowance will permit more baggage than domestic flights, however we strongly encourage and recommend guests on this tour to travel with the domestic baggage allowance in mind, plus a carry-on, to avoid any excess baggage fees and/or delays upon check-in. Tour guides will not be on board the aircraft with you.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n            <p>8. Train Travel – If your trip includes train travel, note that some handling of your own luggage is required while making your way through the train station. There is space on board the train for luggage, but space is limited so we encourage traveling with only 1 suitcase and 1 carry on bag. Tour guides will not be on board the train with you.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n            <p>9. Handicrafts, Shopping & Cultural Insights – This tour, and with travel in China and many other countries in the world, there are shopping/comfort stops on tour where you can learn & shop, take a rest, or just stretch your legs. This is a normal practice in China where even just a quick stop helps with your total trip cost. The tour guides must make these stops, although they can be brief, and no purchase is necessary. This is not a shopping tour in that you are shopping all-day-everyday, but there are some educational shopping components included in the itinerary. These shopping and cultural stops for some are a highlight, and for others they do not hold much interest, we understand, so if you are not interested in a trip with shopping stops included, please speak with your travel consultant at time of booking as this trip may not be for you. Some guests may find that some stops are more interesting than others, so if you are not interested in shopping, please use this time for a bathroom break, to rest, or to simply learn more about China’s specialty products. Many of these specialty shops offer quality products and international shipping service. Your local guides will keep you well informed on tour, but if you would like to speak further on this beforehand, please contact your travel consultant.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n            <p>10. Physical & Cultural Preparation – Please be prepared for walking with comfortable shoes. You will find that walking is common on your daily excursions, some of which will be on uneven terrain or city streets, in museums, around indoor/outdoor attractions with varied grounds, and other landscapes. Although your tour includes porterage at the hotels and on/off coaches or in/out of smaller vehicles, all guests will need to carry their own luggage inside the airports/train stations and in other various instances. This is kept to a minimum, but keep in mind that there will be some lifting of your own luggage throughout your tour. You can expect a level of culture shock from exposure to different lifestyles and signs of poverty to varied cuisines and limited English accessibility in certain locations. To respect the local culture is paramount and will help with adjusting and truly experiencing and immersing yourself in the country. Should you have any particular considerations (ie; mobility, dietary, etc.) please be sure to let us and/or your travel agent know at the earliest to ensure this trip is right for you and/or that the necessary arrangements can be made.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n            <p>11. On-Tour Baggage – We recommend that guests bring one suitcase with wheels that weighs 20kg / 44lbs or less, and one carry-on at no more than 7kg. We do not suggest traveling with more than one large suitcase each to keep your transit comfortable and without excess baggage fees. Vehicles used on this trip have adequate space for each person to travel with one large suitcase and one carry-on, along with a camera bag, day bag, and/or purse, for example. If you plan to travel with more luggage than this on your trip, please advise your travel consultant to ensure ample space is available.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n            <p>12. Weather – The climate of China is temperate, similar to parts of the United States and Canada. As China is a large country covering vast geographic points from the high altitudes of Tibet to the deserts of Northwest China to the coastal city of Shanghai and southern tropics of Hainan Island, the weather you can anticipate will vary greatly on the season you are traveling and the destinations that are part of your tour. In short, Spring and Fall months are ideal, summer can be uncomfortably hot and sticky and winter quite cold with regional snow.<br>\r\nThe rainy (or monsoon) season extends from April to October, with varying degrees of rain from region to region.<br>\r\nWhile China is a year-round destination, the months of May, September, and October are ideal months for travel anywhere in the country. In the north, the winters are cold, and summers warm, with moist monsoon air streams making it hot. Note that 80% of China's rainfall occurs between late May and early October, mostly in the Southern regions. June through August is a good time to visit central and northern China. Spring and autumn are the best months for travel in Southern China.<br>\r\nSevere rainstorms can cause flooding and landslides. Flooding is common in central, western and southern China, particularly areas bordering the Yangtze River. Typhoons are common along the southern and eastern coasts. Keep informed of regional weather forecasts, avoid disaster areas and follow the advice of local authorities. Air pollution is severe, especially in heavily industrialized areas. Monitor air pollution levels as they change quickly. Your local guide will keep you informed of weather patterns during your tour.<br>\r\nAs a guideline of what to anticipate on your trip, kindly note below for average temperatures for Beijing & Shanghai. This is a guideline only, weather patterns vary year to year and remain unpredictable.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n            <p>13. Itinerary Disclaimer – Occasionally our itineraries must be modified due to inclement weather, seasonal transport route amendments, government functions, traffic/roadwork/detours, and/or force majeure. Changes, although rare, may occur with little or no notice, so please be prepared for adjustments to the itinerary if necessary.</p>\r\n        </div>",

Seat numbers are assigned by the airline and are released at time of issuing tickets. For those who wish to change their seats can do so upon check-in at the airport, subject to availability. Tour East Holidays cannot specifically assign and/or change seats due to airline group policy, and therefore cannot be held responsible for Air Canada’s seat assignment. Aeroplan points are not applicable on this trip. If departing from another city (not Toronto), please contact us at tour@toureast.com or 1.877.578.8888 for exclusive rates & schedules for other departure cities.As deviations are not permitted, if interested in departing earlier, staying later, or extending the trip, please contact us and we’ll be pleased to quote accordingly.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n       <br />\r\n        <div>\r\n            <strong>Prepaid Gratuities - INCLUDED:</strong>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div>\r\n            <p>Tipping is entrenched in tourism in China and certainly helps to encourage continued exceptional service.  For this tour, we facilitate pre-paid gratuities for your guides and drivers for your convenience and to ensure that you can simply enjoy your holiday without having to consider who & when to tip. These gratuities/tips are included in your trip cost. If you wish to tip over and above when in-destination, you may do so at your discretion locally. For any other service rendered, whether it be a pedicab ride, boat ride, meal, or another service provided, a nominal gratuity would be most appreciated. Your tour guides will keep you informed as necessary.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n       <br />\r\n        <div>\r\n            <strong>China Entry Visa & Travel Documents:</strong>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div>\r\n            <p>Canadian & U.S. citizens traveling to China require a visa to enter the country. The China visa must be applied for & obtained in advance. Citizens of other countries should contact an embassy or consulate to determine what travel documentation is required. For residents of Ontario and Manitoba, Tour East can help to facilitate your China visas for this trip at the fee as indicated, or you may wish to handle the visa application on your own in which this visa fee will be deducted from your invoice. For travelers who reside outside Ontario, it is recommended to coordinate your visa application with the respective Visa Application Center from your home province. We suggest to start arranging for your visa, either through Tour East or on your own, after final payment at about 60 days prior to departure. For full and detailed information on how to obtain your entry visa to China along with fees, locations, and more, please visit the following website or contact your travel consultant - http://www.visaforchina.org/. If you are applying for your visa on your own, please let your agent know as you may require additional documentation to submit. If you choose to do the visa application with Tour East, kindly note a brief summary of requirements below and speak with your travel consultant before submission as the visa application center changes their requirements frequently.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n       <br />\r\n        <div>\r\n            <strong>Requirements & Process:</strong>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div>\r\n            <p>1.Original passport valid for 6 months from the completion date of your trip.</p>\r\n            <p>2.Completed and signed China Visa application form.

Passport - A valid passport is required for this trip. Your passport must have at least two blank visa pages and an expiration date of at least six months beyond the completion of your travel dates.</p>\r\n            <p>2. Accommodation - Accommodation used on this tour is at the international 4-star standard and is as outlined on the tour page on the Tour East website. Note that accommodation occasionally changes, but where and when this may be required, a similar or better alternative will be provided and advised before you depart on your tour. Hotels are based on two people sharing one room with 2 beds or 1 bed. For Triple Rooms, these are on request and will be 1 bed + extra rollaway bed, or a room with two beds to be shared between three people. Accommodation is adequate, but is not the primary focus of this trip. If looking for a luxury trip to China, or a tour using alternative hotels, please contact your travel consultant where a tailor-made and privately guided tour and itinerary can be customized especially for you to meet your requirements, interests and budget.</p>\r\n            <p>3. Meals - Meals are included as specified on the itinerary. Beverages are not included, with the exception of bottled water & Chinese tea. The included lunches & dinners on your tour will be at local Chinese restaurants in a group setting, unless otherwise mentioned, with an abundance of food to choose from. Your guide will be with you to assist with any questions and/or special requests. Breakfast is at the hotel with a selection of western and Chinese dishes. Some specific dietary requirements can be accommodated in China and some are more difficult; for any dietary restrictions, please advise your booking agent at your earliest convenience for advice and/or adjustments to be made. Occasionally, a supplement is applicable if additional arrangements are to be made to meet dietary requirements. Guide recommendations can be provided if desired for any excluded meals.</p>\r\n            <p>4. Sightseeing - All sightseeing tours as outlined in the itinerary are included with English speaking local guides in a vehicle chartered for the group. Optional tours are outlined as such and are offered at additional cost should you be interested. You may book and pay for the optional tours prior to departure with some savings, or opt to play-it-by-ear and book and pay on the spot with your tour guide. Please note that the English-speaking guides and drivers in each city, town or area, will not fly with you from one city to another. They are your expert local guides in each of their particular regions. Tour East reserves the right to adjust the sequence of sightseeing if required to ensure all listed excursions are included. Please use sightseeing order on the itinerary as a guideline.</p>\r\n            <p>5. Airport Transportation - For international arrivals/departures, transfers are included with meet & greet. A representative will be at the airport holding a signboard for easy identification. You will then be driven to your hotel for check-in.</p>\r\n            <p>6. Optional Tours - In addition to your included tours, there are some additional optional activities/shows that are offered with this trip. Note below for a summary. If you wish to pre-book any of these optional tours with your trip, please advise your travel consultant. You may also wish to book these locally on the spot with your tour guide where a slightly higher cost will be applicable.</p>\r\n            <p>7. Domestic Flights – If your trip includes domestic flights within China, the checked baggage allowance is limited to one piece per person (weight up to 20 kg). Excess baggage may incur baggage fees levied by the airlines. Note that your international flight baggage allowance will permit more baggage than domestic flights, however we strongly encourage and recommend guests on this tour to travel with the domestic baggage allowance in mind, plus a carry-on, to avoid any excess baggage fees and/or delays upon check-in. Tour guides will not be on board the aircraft with you.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n            <p>8. Train Travel – If your trip includes train travel, note that some handling of your own luggage is required while making your way through the train station. There is space on board the train for luggage, but space is limited so we encourage traveling with only 1 suitcase and 1 carry on bag. Tour guides will not be on board the train with you.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n            <p>9. Handicrafts, Shopping & Cultural Insights – This tour, and with travel in China and many other countries in the world, there are shopping/comfort stops on tour where you can learn & shop, take a rest, or just stretch your legs. This is a normal practice in China where even just a quick stop helps with your total trip cost. The tour guides must make these stops, although they can be brief, and no purchase is necessary. This is not a shopping tour in that you are shopping all-day-everyday, but there are some educational shopping components included in the itinerary. These shopping and cultural stops for some are a highlight, and for others they do not hold much interest, we understand, so if you are not interested in a trip with shopping stops included, please speak with your travel consultant at time of booking as this trip may not be for you. Some guests may find that some stops are more interesting than others, so if you are not interested in shopping, please use this time for a bathroom break, to rest, or to simply learn more about China’s specialty products. Many of these specialty shops offer quality products and international shipping service. Your local guides will keep you well informed on tour, but if you would like to speak further on this beforehand, please contact your travel consultant.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n            <p>10. Physical & Cultural Preparation – Please be prepared for walking with comfortable shoes. You will find that walking is common on your daily excursions, some of which will be on uneven terrain or city streets, in museums, around indoor/outdoor attractions with varied grounds, and other landscapes. Although your tour includes porterage at the hotels and on/off coaches or in/out of smaller vehicles, all guests will need to carry their own luggage inside the airports/train stations and in other various instances. This is kept to a minimum, but keep in mind that there will be some lifting of your own luggage throughout your tour. You can expect a level of culture shock from exposure to different lifestyles and signs of poverty to varied cuisines and limited English accessibility in certain locations. To respect the local culture is paramount and will help with adjusting and truly experiencing and immersing yourself in the country. Should you have any particular considerations (ie; mobility, dietary, etc.) please be sure to let us and/or your travel agent know at the earliest to ensure this trip is right for you and/or that the necessary arrangements can be made.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n            <p>11. On-Tour Baggage – We recommend that guests bring one suitcase with wheels that weighs 20kg / 44lbs or less, and one carry-on at no more than 7kg. We do not suggest traveling with more than one large suitcase each to keep your transit comfortable and without excess baggage fees. Vehicles used on this trip have adequate space for each person to travel with one large suitcase and one carry-on, along with a camera bag, day bag, and/or purse, for example. If you plan to travel with more luggage than this on your trip, please advise your travel consultant to ensure ample space is available.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n            <p>12. Weather – The climate of China is temperate, similar to parts of the United States and Canada. As China is a large country covering vast geographic points from the high altitudes of Tibet to the deserts of Northwest China to the coastal city of Shanghai and southern tropics of Hainan Island, the weather you can anticipate will vary greatly on the season you are traveling and the destinations that are part of your tour. In short, Spring and Fall months are ideal, summer can be uncomfortably hot and sticky and winter quite cold with regional snow.<br>\r\nThe rainy (or monsoon) season extends from April to October, with varying degrees of rain from region to region.<br>\r\nWhile China is a year-round destination, the months of May, September, and October are ideal months for travel anywhere in the country. In the north, the winters are cold, and summers warm, with moist monsoon air streams making it hot. Note that 80% of China's rainfall occurs between late May and early October, mostly in the Southern regions. June through August is a good time to visit central and northern China. Spring and autumn are the best months for travel in Southern China.<br>\r\nSevere rainstorms can cause flooding and landslides. Flooding is common in central, western and southern China, particularly areas bordering the Yangtze River. Typhoons are common along the southern and eastern coasts. Keep informed of regional weather forecasts, avoid disaster areas and follow the advice of local authorities. Air pollution is severe, especially in heavily industrialized areas. Monitor air pollution levels as they change quickly. Your local guide will keep you informed of weather patterns during your tour.<br>\r\nAs a guideline of what to anticipate on your trip, kindly note below for average temperatures for Beijing & Shanghai. This is a guideline only, weather patterns vary year to year and remain unpredictable.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n            <p>13. Itinerary Disclaimer – Occasionally our itineraries must be modified due to inclement weather, seasonal transport route amendments, government functions, traffic/roadwork/detours, and/or force majeure. Changes, although rare, may occur with little or no notice, so please be prepared for adjustments to the itinerary if necessary.</p>\r\n        </div>",

These are direct, non-stop, flights to Beijing from Toronto and from Shanghai back to Toronto. No deviations are permitted. Note that Tour East Holidays must abide by Air Canada’s group policy on seating and cannot guarantee that all travelers will have seats that meet each guest’s requirements. Seat numbers are assigned by the airline and are released at time of issuing tickets. For those who wish to change their seats can do so upon check-in at the airport, subject to availability. Tour East Holidays cannot specifically assign and/or change seats due to airline group policy, and therefore cannot be held responsible for Air Canada’s seat assignment. Aeroplan points are not applicable on this trip. If departing from another city (not Toronto), please contact us at tour@toureast.com or 1.877.578.8888 for exclusive rates & schedules for other departure cities.As deviations are not permitted, if interested in departing earlier, staying later, or extending the trip, please contact us and we’ll be pleased to quote accordingly.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n       <br />\r\n        <div>\r\n            <strong>Prepaid Gratuities - INCLUDED:</strong>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div>\r\n            <p>Tipping is entrenched in tourism in China and certainly helps to encourage continued exceptional service.  For this tour, we facilitate pre-paid gratuities for your guides and drivers for your convenience and to ensure that you can simply enjoy your holiday without having to consider who & when to tip. These gratuities/tips are included in your trip cost. If you wish to tip over and above when in-destination, you may do so at your discretion locally. For any other service rendered, whether it be a pedicab ride, boat ride, meal, or another service provided, a nominal gratuity would be most appreciated. Your tour guides will keep you informed as necessary.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n       <br />\r\n        <div>\r\n            <strong>China Entry Visa & Travel Documents:</strong>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div>\r\n            <p>Canadian & U.S. citizens traveling to China require a visa to enter the country. The China visa must be applied for & obtained in advance. Citizens of other countries should contact an embassy or consulate to determine what travel documentation is required. For residents of Ontario and Manitoba, Tour East can help to facilitate your China visas for this trip at the fee as indicated, or you may wish to handle the visa application on your own in which this visa fee will be deducted from your invoice. For travelers who reside outside Ontario, it is recommended to coordinate your visa application with the respective Visa Application Center from your home province. We suggest to start arranging for your visa, either through Tour East or on your own, after final payment at about 60 days prior to departure. For full and detailed information on how to obtain your entry visa to China along with fees, locations, and more, please visit the following website or contact your travel consultant - http://www.visaforchina.org/. If you are applying for your visa on your own, please let your agent know as you may require additional documentation to submit. If you choose to do the visa application with Tour East, kindly note a brief summary of requirements below and speak with your travel consultant before submission as the visa application center changes their requirements frequently.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n       <br />\r\n        <div>\r\n            <strong>Requirements & Process:</strong>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div>\r\n            <p>1.Original passport valid for 6 months from the completion date of your trip.</p>\r\n            <p>2.Completed and signed China Visa application form.

Canadian consular officials cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet entry requirements. This information on entry and exit requirements has been obtained from the Chinese authorities. However, these requirements are subject to change at any time.</p>\r\n            <p>The cost for the China entry visa is non-refundable.</p>           \r\n        </div>\r\n       <br />\r\n        <div>\r\n            <strong>Important Note: </strong>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div>\r\n            <p>If your passport shows that your place of birth is Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, or China, please contact us and/or the visa application center for additional requirements before submitting.</p>\r\n            <p>1. Passport - A valid passport is required for this trip. Your passport must have at least two blank visa pages and an expiration date of at least six months beyond the completion of your travel dates.</p>\r\n            <p>2. Accommodation - Accommodation used on this tour is at the international 4-star standard and is as outlined on the tour page on the Tour East website. Note that accommodation occasionally changes, but where and when this may be required, a similar or better alternative will be provided and advised before you depart on your tour. Hotels are based on two people sharing one room with 2 beds or 1 bed. For Triple Rooms, these are on request and will be 1 bed + extra rollaway bed, or a room with two beds to be shared between three people. Accommodation is adequate, but is not the primary focus of this trip. If looking for a luxury trip to China, or a tour using alternative hotels, please contact your travel consultant where a tailor-made and privately guided tour and itinerary can be customized especially for you to meet your requirements, interests and budget.</p>\r\n            <p>3. Meals - Meals are included as specified on the itinerary. Beverages are not included, with the exception of bottled water & Chinese tea. The included lunches & dinners on your tour will be at local Chinese restaurants in a group setting, unless otherwise mentioned, with an abundance of food to choose from. Your guide will be with you to assist with any questions and/or special requests. Breakfast is at the hotel with a selection of western and Chinese dishes. Some specific dietary requirements can be accommodated in China and some are more difficult; for any dietary restrictions, please advise your booking agent at your earliest convenience for advice and/or adjustments to be made. Occasionally, a supplement is applicable if additional arrangements are to be made to meet dietary requirements. Guide recommendations can be provided if desired for any excluded meals.</p>\r\n            <p>4. Sightseeing - All sightseeing tours as outlined in the itinerary are included with English speaking local guides in a vehicle chartered for the group. Optional tours are outlined as such and are offered at additional cost should you be interested. You may book and pay for the optional tours prior to departure with some savings, or opt to play-it-by-ear and book and pay on the spot with your tour guide. Please note that the English-speaking guides and drivers in each city, town or area, will not fly with you from one city to another. They are your expert local guides in each of their particular regions. Tour East reserves the right to adjust the sequence of sightseeing if required to ensure all listed excursions are included. Please use sightseeing order on the itinerary as a guideline.</p>\r\n            <p>5. Airport Transportation - For international arrivals/departures, transfers are included with meet & greet. A representative will be at the airport holding a signboard for easy identification. You will then be driven to your hotel for check-in.</p>\r\n            <p>6. Optional Tours - In addition to your included tours, there are some additional optional activities/shows that are offered with this trip. Note below for a summary. If you wish to pre-book any of these optional tours with your trip, please advise your travel consultant. You may also wish to book these locally on the spot with your tour guide where a slightly higher cost will be applicable.</p>\r\n            <p>7. Domestic Flights – If your trip includes domestic flights within China, the checked baggage allowance is limited to one piece per person (weight up to 20 kg). Excess baggage may incur baggage fees levied by the airlines. Note that your international flight baggage allowance will permit more baggage than domestic flights, however we strongly encourage and recommend guests on this tour to travel with the domestic baggage allowance in mind, plus a carry-on, to avoid any excess baggage fees and/or delays upon check-in. Tour guides will not be on board the aircraft with you.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n            <p>8. Train Travel – If your trip includes train travel, note that some handling of your own luggage is required while making your way through the train station. There is space on board the train for luggage, but space is limited so we encourage traveling with only 1 suitcase and 1 carry on bag. Tour guides will not be on board the train with you.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n            <p>9. Handicrafts, Shopping & Cultural Insights – This tour, and with travel in China and many other countries in the world, there are shopping/comfort stops on tour where you can learn & shop, take a rest, or just stretch your legs. This is a normal practice in China where even just a quick stop helps with your total trip cost. The tour guides must make these stops, although they can be brief, and no purchase is necessary. This is not a shopping tour in that you are shopping all-day-everyday, but there are some educational shopping components included in the itinerary. These shopping and cultural stops for some are a highlight, and for others they do not hold much interest, we understand, so if you are not interested in a trip with shopping stops included, please speak with your travel consultant at time of booking as this trip may not be for you. Some guests may find that some stops are more interesting than others, so if you are not interested in shopping, please use this time for a bathroom break, to rest, or to simply learn more about China’s specialty products. Many of these specialty shops offer quality products and international shipping service. Your local guides will keep you well informed on tour, but if you would like to speak further on this beforehand, please contact your travel consultant.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n            <p>10. Physical & Cultural Preparation – Please be prepared for walking with comfortable shoes. You will find that walking is common on your daily excursions, some of which will be on uneven terrain or city streets, in museums, around indoor/outdoor attractions with varied grounds, and other landscapes. Although your tour includes porterage at the hotels and on/off coaches or in/out of smaller vehicles, all guests will need to carry their own luggage inside the airports/train stations and in other various instances. This is kept to a minimum, but keep in mind that there will be some lifting of your own luggage throughout your tour. You can expect a level of culture shock from exposure to different lifestyles and signs of poverty to varied cuisines and limited English accessibility in certain locations. To respect the local culture is paramount and will help with adjusting and truly experiencing and immersing yourself in the country. Should you have any particular considerations (ie; mobility, dietary, etc.) please be sure to let us and/or your travel agent know at the earliest to ensure this trip is right for you and/or that the necessary arrangements can be made.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n            <p>11. On-Tour Baggage – We recommend that guests bring one suitcase with wheels that weighs 20kg / 44lbs or less, and one carry-on at no more than 7kg. We do not suggest traveling with more than one large suitcase each to keep your transit comfortable and without excess baggage fees. Vehicles used on this trip have adequate space for each person to travel with one large suitcase and one carry-on, along with a camera bag, day bag, and/or purse, for example. If you plan to travel with more luggage than this on your trip, please advise your travel consultant to ensure ample space is available.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n            <p>12. Weather – The climate of China is temperate, similar to parts of the United States and Canada. As China is a large country covering vast geographic points from the high altitudes of Tibet to the deserts of Northwest China to the coastal city of Shanghai and southern tropics of Hainan Island, the weather you can anticipate will vary greatly on the season you are traveling and the destinations that are part of your tour. In short, Spring and Fall months are ideal, summer can be uncomfortably hot and sticky and winter quite cold with regional snow.<br>\r\nThe rainy (or monsoon) season extends from April to October, with varying degrees of rain from region to region.<br>\r\nWhile China is a year-round destination, the months of May, September, and October are ideal months for travel anywhere in the country. In the north, the winters are cold, and summers warm, with moist monsoon air streams making it hot. Note that 80% of China's rainfall occurs between late May and early October, mostly in the Southern regions. June through August is a good time to visit central and northern China. Spring and autumn are the best months for travel in Southern China.<br>\r\nSevere rainstorms can cause flooding and landslides. Flooding is common in central, western and southern China, particularly areas bordering the Yangtze River. Typhoons are common along the southern and eastern coasts. Keep informed of regional weather forecasts, avoid disaster areas and follow the advice of local authorities. Air pollution is severe, especially in heavily industrialized areas. Monitor air pollution levels as they change quickly. Your local guide will keep you informed of weather patterns during your tour.<br>\r\nAs a guideline of what to anticipate on your trip, kindly note below for average temperatures for Beijing & Shanghai. This is a guideline only, weather patterns vary year to year and remain unpredictable.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n            <p>13. Itinerary Disclaimer – Occasionally our itineraries must be modified due to inclement weather, seasonal transport route amendments, government functions, traffic/roadwork/detours, and/or force majeure. Changes, although rare, may occur with little or no notice, so please be prepared for adjustments to the itinerary if necessary.</p>\r\n        </div>",

These are direct, non-stop, flights to Beijing from Toronto and from Shanghai back to Toronto. No deviations are permitted. Note that Tour East Holidays must abide by Air Canada’s group policy on seating and cannot guarantee that all travelers will have seats that meet each guest’s requirements. Seat numbers are assigned by the airline and are released at time of issuing tickets. For those who wish to change their seats can do so upon check-in at the airport, subject to availability. Tour East Holidays cannot specifically assign and/or change seats due to airline group policy, and therefore cannot be held responsible for Air Canada’s seat assignment. Aeroplan points are not applicable on this trip. If departing from another city (not Toronto), please contact us at tour@toureast.com or 1.877.578.8888 for exclusive rates & schedules for other departure cities.As deviations are not permitted, if interested in departing earlier, staying later, or extending the trip, please contact us and we’ll be pleased to quote accordingly.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n       <br />\r\n        <div>\r\n            <strong>Prepaid Gratuities - INCLUDED:</strong>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div>\r\n            <p>Tipping is entrenched in tourism in China and certainly helps to encourage continued exceptional service.  For this tour, we facilitate pre-paid gratuities for your guides and drivers for your convenience and to ensure that you can simply enjoy your holiday without having to consider who & when to tip. These gratuities/tips are included in your trip cost. If you wish to tip over and above when in-destination, you may do so at your discretion locally. For any other service rendered, whether it be a pedicab ride, boat ride, meal, or another service provided, a nominal gratuity would be most appreciated. Your tour guides will keep you informed as necessary.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n       <br />\r\n        <div>\r\n            <strong>China Entry Visa & Travel Documents:</strong>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div>\r\n            <p>Canadian & U.S. citizens traveling to China require a visa to enter the country. The China visa must be applied for & obtained in advance. Citizens of other countries should contact an embassy or consulate to determine what travel documentation is required. For residents of Ontario and Manitoba, Tour East can help to facilitate your China visas for this trip at the fee as indicated, or you may wish to handle the visa application on your own in which this visa fee will be deducted from your invoice. For travelers who reside outside Ontario, it is recommended to coordinate your visa application with the respective Visa Application Center from your home province. We suggest to start arranging for your visa, either through Tour East or on your own, after final payment at about 60 days prior to departure. For full and detailed information on how to obtain your entry visa to China along with fees, locations, and more, please visit the following website or contact your travel consultant - http://www.visaforchina.org/. If you are applying for your visa on your own, please let your agent know as you may require additional documentation to submit. If you choose to do the visa application with Tour East, kindly note a brief summary of requirements below and speak with your travel consultant before submission as the visa application center changes their requirements frequently.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n       <br />\r\n        <div>\r\n            <strong>Requirements & Process:</strong>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div>\r\n            <p>1.Original passport valid for 6 months from the completion date of your trip.</p>\r\n            <p>2.Completed and signed China Visa application form.

Canadian consular officials cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet entry requirements. This information on entry and exit requirements has been obtained from the Chinese authorities. However, these requirements are subject to change at any time.</p>\r\n            <p>The cost for the China entry visa is non-refundable.</p>           \r\n        </div>\r\n       <br />\r\n        <div>\r\n            <strong>Important Note: </strong>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div>\r\n            <p>If your passport shows that your place of birth is Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, or China, please contact us and/or the visa application center for additional requirements before submitting.</p>\r\n            <p>1. Passport - A valid passport is required for this trip. Your passport must have at least two blank visa pages and an expiration date of at least six months beyond the completion of your travel dates.</p>\r\n            <p>2. Accommodation - Accommodation used on this tour is at the international 4-star standard and is as outlined on the tour page on the Tour East website. Note that accommodation occasionally changes, but where and when this may be required, a similar or better alternative will be provided and advised before you depart on your tour. Hotels are based on two people sharing one room with 2 beds or 1 bed. For Triple Rooms, these are on request and will be 1 bed + extra rollaway bed, or a room with two beds to be shared between three people. Accommodation is adequate, but is not the primary focus of this trip. If looking for a luxury trip to China, or a tour using alternative hotels, please contact your travel consultant where a tailor-made and privately guided tour and itinerary can be customized especially for you to meet your requirements, interests and budget.</p>\r\n            <p>3. Meals - Meals are included as specified on the itinerary. Beverages are not included, with the exception of bottled water & Chinese tea. The included lunches & dinners on your tour will be at local Chinese restaurants in a group setting, unless otherwise mentioned, with an abundance of food to choose from. Your guide will be with you to assist with any questions and/or special requests. Breakfast is at the hotel with a selection of western and Chinese dishes. Some specific dietary requirements can be accommodated in China and some are more difficult; for any dietary restrictions, please advise your booking agent at your earliest convenience for advice and/or adjustments to be made. Occasionally, a supplement is applicable if additional arrangements are to be made to meet dietary requirements. Guide recommendations can be provided if desired for any excluded meals.</p>\r\n            <p>4. Sightseeing - All sightseeing tours as outlined in the itinerary are included with English speaking local guides in a vehicle chartered for the group. Optional tours are outlined as such and are offered at additional cost should you be interested. You may book and pay for the optional tours prior to departure with some savings, or opt to play-it-by-ear and book and pay on the spot with your tour guide. Please note that the English-speaking guides and drivers in each city, town or area, will not fly with you from one city to another. They are your expert local guides in each of their particular regions. Tour East reserves the right to adjust the sequence of sightseeing if required to ensure all listed excursions are included. Please use sightseeing order on the itinerary as a guideline.</p>\r\n            <p>5. Airport Transportation - For international arrivals/departures, transfers are included with meet & greet. A representative will be at the airport holding a signboard for easy identification. You will then be driven to your hotel for check-in.</p>\r\n            <p>6. Optional Tours - In addition to your included tours, there are some additional optional activities/shows that are offered with this trip. Note below for a summary. If you wish to pre-book any of these optional tours with your trip, please advise your travel consultant. You may also wish to book these locally on the spot with your tour guide where a slightly higher cost will be applicable.</p>\r\n            <p>7. Domestic Flights – If your trip includes domestic flights within China, the checked baggage allowance is limited to one piece per person (weight up to 20 kg). Excess baggage may incur baggage fees levied by the airlines. Note that your international flight baggage allowance will permit more baggage than domestic flights, however we strongly encourage and recommend guests on this tour to travel with the domestic baggage allowance in mind, plus a carry-on, to avoid any excess baggage fees and/or delays upon check-in. Tour guides will not be on board the aircraft with you.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n            <p>8. Train Travel – If your trip includes train travel, note that some handling of your own luggage is required while making your way through the train station. There is space on board the train for luggage, but space is limited so we encourage traveling with only 1 suitcase and 1 carry on bag. Tour guides will not be on board the train with you.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n            <p>9. Handicrafts, Shopping & Cultural Insights – This tour, and with travel in China and many other countries in the world, there are shopping/comfort stops on tour where you can learn & shop, take a rest, or just stretch your legs. This is a normal practice in China where even just a quick stop helps with your total trip cost. The tour guides must make these stops, although they can be brief, and no purchase is necessary. This is not a shopping tour in that you are shopping all-day-everyday, but there are some educational shopping components included in the itinerary. These shopping and cultural stops for some are a highlight, and for others they do not hold much interest, we understand, so if you are not interested in a trip with shopping stops included, please speak with your travel consultant at time of booking as this trip may not be for you. Some guests may find that some stops are more interesting than others, so if you are not interested in shopping, please use this time for a bathroom break, to rest, or to simply learn more about China’s specialty products. Many of these specialty shops offer quality products and international shipping service. Your local guides will keep you well informed on tour, but if you would like to speak further on this beforehand, please contact your travel consultant.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n            <p>10. Physical & Cultural Preparation – Please be prepared for walking with comfortable shoes. You will find that walking is common on your daily excursions, some of which will be on uneven terrain or city streets, in museums, around indoor/outdoor attractions with varied grounds, and other landscapes. Although your tour includes porterage at the hotels and on/off coaches or in/out of smaller vehicles, all guests will need to carry their own luggage inside the airports/train stations and in other various instances. This is kept to a minimum, but keep in mind that there will be some lifting of your own luggage throughout your tour. You can expect a level of culture shock from exposure to different lifestyles and signs of poverty to varied cuisines and limited English accessibility in certain locations. To respect the local culture is paramount and will help with adjusting and truly experiencing and immersing yourself in the country. Should you have any particular considerations (ie; mobility, dietary, etc.) please be sure to let us and/or your travel agent know at the earliest to ensure this trip is right for you and/or that the necessary arrangements can be made.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n            <p>11. On-Tour Baggage – We recommend that guests bring one suitcase with wheels that weighs 20kg / 44lbs or less, and one carry-on at no more than 7kg. We do not suggest traveling with more than one large suitcase each to keep your transit comfortable and without excess baggage fees. Vehicles used on this trip have adequate space for each person to travel with one large suitcase and one carry-on, along with a camera bag, day bag, and/or purse, for example. If you plan to travel with more luggage than this on your trip, please advise your travel consultant to ensure ample space is available.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n            <p>12. Weather – The climate of China is temperate, similar to parts of the United States and Canada. As China is a large country covering vast geographic points from the high altitudes of Tibet to the deserts of Northwest China to the coastal city of Shanghai and southern tropics of Hainan Island, the weather you can anticipate will vary greatly on the season you are traveling and the destinations that are part of your tour. In short, Spring and Fall months are ideal, summer can be uncomfortably hot and sticky and winter quite cold with regional snow.<br>\r\nThe rainy (or monsoon) season extends from April to October, with varying degrees of rain from region to region.<br>\r\nWhile China is a year-round destination, the months of May, September, and October are ideal months for travel anywhere in the country. In the north, the winters are cold, and summers warm, with moist monsoon air streams making it hot. Note that 80% of China's rainfall occurs between late May and early October, mostly in the Southern regions. June through August is a good time to visit central and northern China. Spring and autumn are the best months for travel in Southern China.<br>\r\nSevere rainstorms can cause flooding and landslides. Flooding is common in central, western and southern China, particularly areas bordering the Yangtze River. Typhoons are common along the southern and eastern coasts. Keep informed of regional weather forecasts, avoid disaster areas and follow the advice of local authorities. Air pollution is severe, especially in heavily industrialized areas. Monitor air pollution levels as they change quickly. Your local guide will keep you informed of weather patterns during your tour.<br>\r\nAs a guideline of what to anticipate on your trip, kindly note below for average temperatures for Beijing & Shanghai. This is a guideline only, weather patterns vary year to year and remain unpredictable.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n            <p>13. Itinerary Disclaimer – Occasionally our itineraries must be modified due to inclement weather, seasonal transport route amendments, government functions, traffic/roadwork/detours, and/or force majeure. Changes, although rare, may occur with little or no notice, so please be prepared for adjustments to the itinerary if necessary.</p>\r\n        </div>",
